- Fixed `Query.Encode()` to produce deterministic output

### Breaking

- Removed `Client` type from root package - use `auth.NewGitHubClient()` + subpackage clients
- Removed `NewClient()` and `NewClientWithToken()` from root package - use `auth.NewGitHubClient()`
- Removed type aliases (`Query`, `Issues`, `Issue`) from root package - import from `search` package
- Removed re-exported constants (`ParamUser`, `ParamState`, etc.) from root package - import from `search` package
- Removed wrapper methods (`SearchOpenPullRequests`, `SearchIssues`, `SearchIssuesAll`) from root package - use `search.Client` methods
- Moved `UsernameDependabot` and `UserIDDependabot` from `search` to `auth` package
- Moved `BaseURLRepoAPI` and `BaseURLRepoHTML` from `search` to root `gogithub` package

### Added

- `AuthError.Unwrap()` method for Go 1.13+ error chain compatibility ([`ca95de0`](https://github.com/grokify/gogithub/commit/ca95de0))
- `AuthError.Err` field to wrap underlying errors ([`ca95de0`](https://github.com/grokify/gogithub/commit/ca95de0))

### Changed

- Root package now contains only package documentation and URL constants
- Bot user constants (`UsernameDependabot`, `UserIDDependabot`) now in `auth` package
- URL constants (`BaseURLRepoAPI`, `BaseURLRepoHTML`) now in root `gogithub` package
- `search/issues.go` now imports URL constants from root package

### Removed

- Removed `Client` type wrapper from root package
- Removed `NewClient()` factory function from root package
- Removed `NewClientWithToken()` factory function from root package
- Removed `Query`, `Issues`, `Issue` type aliases from root package
- Removed all re-exported constants from root package
- Removed `SearchOpenPullRequests()`, `SearchIssues()`, `SearchIssuesAll()` wrapper methods from root package

### Fixed

- `Query.Encode()` now produces deterministic output by sorting keys ([`9be7777`](https://github.com/grokify/gogithub/commit/9be7777))
